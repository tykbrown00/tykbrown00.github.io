<center><a href="tykbrown00.github.io/"> My name is Tyrese Brown and I recently have developed a passion for programming, specifically data science. While the journey has been difficult because I do not come from a traditonal coding background, the process has been humbling and given me an appreciation for the field of study. Here I hope to blend data science with my other passion, fitness, sometime in the near future. Any criticisms about my projects or what I can do to make my site more appealing are more than appreciated.  </center>
